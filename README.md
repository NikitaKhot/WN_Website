Working on it :
1)Logo - WN logo is not fitting in the navbar.
2)About us, services, dropdown and search (additional).[Can be removed if not needed]
3)Start page - background what should be done is not clear.
4)Why Western Nomads?(section) = Images or what kind of icons are to be added need to be discussed
5)Are You a Future Nomad?(section) = Images?
6)No portal (section) =  we can add something more on the other side .
7)Contact us
8)where to add Ninad's calendar with his logo.
9)More animation is to be added.

I have use Images from google for understanding of structure.
